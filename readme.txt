These postgresql-dumps are combined form two sources:

- borderlines: http://tile.openstreetmap.org/world_boundaries-spherical.tgz
- co2-data of the year 2004: http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=co2&d=MDG&f=seriesRowID%3a749

the data has been modified. like the simplification of the geometries and changing the 
names of some countries to join the tables together. Taiwan has also been joined with
china.
