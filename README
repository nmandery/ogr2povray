data. At this point only polygon geometries in WGS84 projection are 
supported.

The requirements:
 * gdal library and the python bindings
 * povray


An example rendering is at doc/_static/worldcarbonfootprint.jpg
The data used for this rendering is downloaded for geocommons.org - 
for more indo see date/data_info.txt

To render the example use
 make render



Additionaly there are also some pretty unfinished docs in the 
doc directory. See doc/source/index.rst for or generate the 
HTML-docs with sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/):

 make html
